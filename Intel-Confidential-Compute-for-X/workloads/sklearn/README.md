# Intel® Confidential Compute for Scikit-learn

In the following two sections, we explain how a Docker image for a Gramine-protected Scikit-learn
version can be built and how the image can be executed.
We assume that the [prerequisites](../../README.md)
for the build and the execution phase are met.


## Build a Gramine-protected Scikit-learn image

Perform the following steps on your system:

1. Clone the Gramine Contrib repository:
    ```sh
    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib.git
    ```

2. Move to the Intel® Confidential Compute for X folder:
    ```sh
    $ cd contrib/Intel-Confidential-Compute-for-X
    ```

3. Perform one of the following alternatives.
    Note that both alternatives assume that the user has build a Docker base image
    (`<base_image_with_scikit-learn>`) containing Scikit-learn and the necessary files.

    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for
        Scikit-learn, perform the following steps:

        1. Install the [prerequisites](base_image_helper/README.md)
            for this workload.

        2. Use the prepared helper script (`base_image_helper/helper.sh`) to generate a Scikit-learn
            Docker image:
            ```sh
            /bin/bash workloads/sklearn/base_image_helper/helper.sh
            ```
            The resulting Docker image is called `sklearn-base`.

        3. Generate Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for
            Scikit-learn, which is based on the just generated `sklearn-base` image:
            ```sh
            python3 ./curate.py sklearn sklearn-base test
            ```
    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured Scikit-learn image based on a user-provided
        Scikit-learn Docker image, execute the following to launch an interactive setup script:
        ```sh
        python3 ./curate.py sklearn <base_image_with_scikit-learn>
        ```

## Execute Gramine-protected Scikit-learn image

Follow the output of the image build script `curate.py` to run the generated Docker image.

Note that validation was only done on a Standard_DC48ds_v3 Azure VM.

This directory contains the following artifacts, which help to create a Gramine-protected
Scikit-learn image:
