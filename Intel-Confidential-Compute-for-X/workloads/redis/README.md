# Intel® Confidential Compute for Redis

In the following two sections, we explain how a Docker image for a Gramine-protected Redis version
can be built and how the image can be executed.
We assume that the [prerequisites](../../README.md)
for the build and the execution phase are met.


## Build Gramine-protected Redis image

Perform the following steps on your system:

1. Clone the Gramine Contrib repository:
    ```sh
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib.git
    ```

2. Move to the Intel® Confidential Compute for X folder:
    ```sh
    cd contrib/Intel-Confidential-Compute-for-X
    ```

3. Perform one of the following alternatives:
    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for Redis,
        execute the following script:
        ```sh
        python3 ./curate.py redis redis:7.0.0 test
        ```
   - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured Redis image based on a user-provided Redis
        image, execute the following to launch an interactive setup script:
        ```sh
        python3 ./curate.py redis <your_image>
        ```


## Execute Gramine-protected Redis image

Follow the output of the image build script `curate.py` to run the generated Docker image.

Note that validation was only done on a Standard_DC8s_v3 Azure VM.

This directory contains the following artifacts, which help to create a Gramine-protected Redis
image:

    |                                        wrapper dockerfile `redis-gsc.dockerfile` that
    |                                        includes user-provided inputs, e.g., `ca.cert` file,

    |                                        for graminizing Redis images) that will be passed to
    |                                        GSC.
