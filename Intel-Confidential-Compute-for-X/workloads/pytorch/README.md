# Intel® Confidential Compute for PyTorch

In the following two sections, we explain how a Docker image for a Gramine-protected PyTorch version
can be built and how the image can be executed.
We assume that the [prerequisites](../../README.md)
for the build and the execution phase are met.


## Build a Gramine-protected PyTorch image

Perform the following steps on your system:

1. Clone the Gramine Contrib repository:
    ```sh
    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib.git
    ```

2. Move to the Intel® Confidential Compute for X folder:
    ```sh
    $ cd contrib/Intel-Confidential-Compute-for-X
    ```

3. Perform one of the following alternatives.
    Note that both alternatives assume that the user has build a Docker base image
    (`<base_image_with_pytorch>`) containing PyTorch and the necessary files.

    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for PyTorch,
        perform the following steps:

        1. Install the [prerequisites](base_image_helper/README.md#prerequisites)
            for this workload.

        2. Use the prepared helper script (`base_image_helper/helper.sh`) to generate a PyTorch
            Docker image containing an encrypted model and an encrypted sample picture:
            ```sh
            /bin/bash workloads/pytorch/base_image_helper/helper.sh
            ```
            The resulting Docker image is called `pytorch-encrypted`.

        3. Generate Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for
            PyTorch, which is based on the just generated `pytorch-encrypted` image:
            ```sh
            python3 ./curate.py pytorch pytorch-encrypted test
            ```

        4. Run the generated PyTorch image using below command:
            ```sh
            docker run --net=host --device=/dev/sgx/enclave -it gsc-pytorch-encrypted
            ```

    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured PyTorch image based on a user-provided PyTorch
        Docker image, execute the following to launch an interactive setup script:
        ```sh
        python3 ./curate.py pytorch <base_image_with_pytorch>
        ```


## Execute Gramine-protected PyTorch image

Follow the output of the image build script `curate.py` to run the generated Docker image.

Note that validation was only done on a Standard_DC8s_v3 Azure VM.


## Retrieve and decrypt the results

The encrypted results of the execution are generated in `/workspace/result.txt` within the
container.
You need to copy the results from the container to your local machine and decrypt the results using
the following commands:
```sh
docker cp <container id or name>:/workspace/result.txt .
gramine-sgx-pf-crypt decrypt -w encryption_key -i result.txt -o result_plaintext.txt
```
Make sure that the path to your `encryption_key` is correct.

image:
