# Intel® Confidential Compute for Memcached

In the following two sections, we explain how a Docker image for a Gramine-protected Memcached
version can be built and how the image can be executed.
We assume that the [prerequisites](../../README.md)
for the build and the execution phase are met.

## Build a Gramine-protected Memcached image

Perform the following steps on your system:

1. Clone the Gramine Contrib repository:
    ```sh
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib.git
    ```
2. Move to the Intel® Confidential Compute for X folder:
    ```sh
    cd contrib/Intel-Confidential-Compute-for-X
    ```
3. Perform one of the following alternatives:
    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for
    Memcached, execute the following script:
        ```sh
        python3 ./curate.py memcached ubuntu/memcached:1.5-20.04_beta test
        ```
    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured Memcached image based on a user-provided
    Memcached image, execute the following to launch an interactive setup script:
       ```sh
       python3 ./curate.py memcached <your_image>
       ```

## Execute Gramine-protected Memcached image

Follow the output of the image build script `curate.py` to run the generated Docker image.

Note that validation was only done on a Standard_DC8s_v3 Azure VM.
