# Intel® Confidential Compute for TensorFlow Serving

In the following two sections, we explain how a Docker image for a Gramine-protected TensorFlow
Serving version can be built and how the image can be executed.
We assume that the [prerequisites](../../README.md)
for the build and the execution phase are met.


## Build a Gramine-protected TensorFlow Serving image

Perform the following steps on your system:

1. Clone the Gramine Contrib repository:
    ```sh
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gramineproject/contrib.git
    ```

2. Move to the Intel® Confidential Compute for X folder:
    ```sh
    cd contrib/Intel-Confidential-Compute-for-X
    ```

3. Perform one of the following alternatives.
    Note that both alternatives assume that the user has build a Docker base image
    (`<base_image_with_tensorflow-serving>`) containing TensorFlow Serving and the necessary
    application files.

    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for
        TensorFlow Serving, perform the following steps:

        1. Use the prepared helper script (`base_image_helper/helper.sh`) to generate a TensorFlow
            Serving Docker image:
            ```sh
            /bin/bash workloads/tensorflow-serving/base_image_helper/helper.sh
            ```
            The resulting Docker image is called `tf-serving-base`.

        2. Generate Gramine-protected, pre-configured, non-production ready, test image for
            TensorFlow Serving, which is based on the just generated `tf-serving-base` image.
            By default, ResNet is enabled, but you can easily change the model as shown below in the
            "Prepared Models" section.
            ```sh
            python3 ./curate.py tensorflow-serving tf-serving-base test
            ```

    - To generate a Gramine-protected, pre-configured TensorFlow Serving image based on a
        user-provided TensorFlow Serving Docker image, execute the following to launch an
        interactive setup script.
        To select the model that should be used, use the command line arguments described below in
        the "Prepared Models" section.
        ```sh
        python3 ./curate.py tensorflow-serving <base_image_with_tensorflow-serving>
        ```


## Prepared Models

Currently, the following models can be used by just adjusting the `model_name` and `model_base_path`
parameters in the `workloads/tensorflow-serving/insecure_args.txt` file.
- ResNet: `--model_name="resnet" --model_base_path="/models/resnet"`
- MNIST: `--model_name="mnist" --model_base_path="/models/mnist"`
- half_plus_two: `--model_name="half_plus_two" --model_base_path="/models/half_plus_two"`


## Execute Gramine-protected TensorFlow Serving image

Follow the output of the image build script `curate.py` to run the generated Docker image.

Note that validation was only done on a Standard_DC48ds_v3 Azure VM.
