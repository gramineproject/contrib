Package: gramine-ratls-maa
Architecture: amd64
Description: Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA) verifier for RA-TLS
 ra_tls_verify_maa.so library contains the verification callback that should be
 registered with the TLS library during verification of the TLS certificate. It
 verifies the RA-TLS certificate and the SGX quote by sending it to the
 Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA) provider and retrieving the attestation
 response (the JWT) from it.
 .
 secret_prov_verify_maa.so library is used in secret-provisioning services. The
 only difference with secret_prov_verify_epid.so is that this library uses MAA
 based RA-TLS flows underneath.
